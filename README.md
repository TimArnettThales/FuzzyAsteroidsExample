# UCFuzzyChallenge

This repository holds the code needed for the 2021 University of Cincinnati Fuzzy Challenge.

# The Challenge

AI agents will be developed using Machine Learning algorithms and Fuzzy Inference Systems in the game/environment provided. For Spring 2021, the game will be a version of the classic arcade game "Asteroid" where the player/agent controls a vehicle that can move and fire at asteroids around them.

Further details on the competition aspect of the challenge will be decided soon.
